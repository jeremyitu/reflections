What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

"git init" creates a .git folder for storage of repository status and change information
This needs to be done in order for git to manage the files in the directory


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working Directory is the active files ready for modification
Staging area is a list of files cleared to be added to the repository
Repository is the collection of completed code changes for current code activity or sharing

Staging provides a stable code list for assurance the only intented files are added to the repository
